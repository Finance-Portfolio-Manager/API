Portfolio Manager is designed to be a central location for users to track their investment positions. It allows users to enter their stock purchases and sales, which will be reflected in our portfolio, showing both overall and stock-specific gains and losses. It leverages AlphaVantange API and Yahoo Finance to produce real-time stock details. We ensured application security by leveraging JSON Web Tokens and partial integration of Spring Security.
